# SkyFlare

SkyFlare is a dual web development framework with a focus on code habitability, maintenance and logic encapsulation.

**_SkyFlare is currently under heavy development and should not be used in production unless you are a very experienced developer who can troubleshoot and update the framework fundamentals. SkyFlare should be considered pre-alpha_**

SkyFlare was built with a few specific use cases in mind.

* API-only backend applications that need JSON results for consumption by a variety of clients (browser, mobile and custom clients)
* Simplified but secure deployment processes for small teams to reduce automation costs and complexity
* As a modern API layer for legacy applications with minimal changes to legacy code that may not be conducive to modern web development
* Backend and frontend components agnostic of each other but intended to work together
